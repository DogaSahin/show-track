/**
 * This module's contribution to the app's nav graph. `:app` calls it; nothing else can, because
 * nothing else depends on this module (architecture rule 1). The route type comes from
 * `:core:navigation`, so registering a destination costs no knowledge of any other feature.
 *
 * `onNavigate(AuthRoute)` (Gap 2, Phase 9a device walkthroughs): this screen used to have nowhere
 * to go and declared no `onNavigate` parameter at all — `FeedScreen`'s deliberate lack of a
 * default value is the same argument one layer down. Sign-out gave it its first destination.
 * `ShowTrackNavHost`'s router treats a navigation TO `AuthRoute` the same way it already treats
 * one to `LibraryRoute`: it reuses `navigateToAuthClearingStack()`, the same extension the
 * reactive `AuthGate` calls on a failed token refresh, so Back cannot return to a screen whose
 * session is already gone regardless of which path triggered the navigation.
